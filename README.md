# JavaScriptProjects

Testing Javascript from assignments and challenges given throughout the course.

There are 3 main projects added to this repository:

1- The Tic Tac Toe game:

Game where you are playing against the computer, in order to create a row, column or diagonal of crosses. Sound is played when noughts and crosses are placed, and different sounds played when the game is won or there is a tie.

2- The Pizza Ordering page:

Where you can select a pizza size, meat and vegetable toppings and find out how much the pizza will cost you.

3- The ToDo Project:

Where you can input todo items and have them appear, one after the other in a "tabular" layout, with the ability to remove any one task from the list.
